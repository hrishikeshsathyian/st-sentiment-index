It may also cause adjustments to other parts of its balance sheet down the line – a report by accounting consultancy GMT Research said that without supply chain financing, BYD’s true net debt would be closer to 323 billion yuan, compared with the 27.7 billion yuan officially on its books as at the end of June 2024.

“The money laundering risks are higher in such business models and if their substantive regulated activity is outside of Singapore, MAS is unable to effectively supervise such persons,” it said.
Without a licence, existing digital token service providers serving only overseas customers will be required to cease these activities when the regime comes into effect on June 30, said MAS.
In its response on May 30 to feedback on a consultation paper regarding its proposed regulatory framework for digital token service providers, MAS noted that such providers may be more vulnerable to money laundering and terrorism financing risks due to the internet-based and cross-border nature of their services.
MAS also clarified that service providers for digital payment tokens or tokens of capital market products that serve customers in Singapore are already regulated, and there will be no change to what these licensed providers can do.",https://www.straitstimes.com/business/companies-markets/mas-clarifies-position-on-regulation-of-digital-token-service-providers

The combination of inflation and unemployment rising in tandem would leave central bank officials forced to decide whether to prioritise fighting inflation with tighter monetary policy or cutting interest rates to support growth and employment.
The shift caused many analysts to lower recessions risks that Fed staff as of early May had considered “almost as likely as the baseline” of slowing but continued growth.
In a press conference after the meeting, Fed Chair Jerome Powell indicated the central bank was effectively sidelined until the Trump administration finalises its tariff plans and the impact on the economy becomes clearer, a view reiterated by Mr Powell and other Fed policymakers in the weeks since.
